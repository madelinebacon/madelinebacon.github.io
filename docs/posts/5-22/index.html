I can’t stop thinking about that — how small we really are when reduced to matter. I imagine an alien scientist doing it not out of cruelty, but curiosity. To them, we’re just a species to study.

I track the symphony of their neurons as they solve puzzles and hesitate at corners, little windows into cognition. Sometimes they die. Not violently — just quietly, scientifically. I tell myself it’s for something bigger. But as I watch another brain flicker its last signal, I can’t help but wonder: are we the scientists, or are we the meatball?</p><p>PS check out the number 15 from jersey mikes</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
