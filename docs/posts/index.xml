They plan the dates, book the tables, and triple-check that the fondue pot is preheated just right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, the rats roll in late, chew through the wires, and somehow still leave with the biggest slice of gouda. The hamsters spin their wheels, the ferrets stir the drama—and yet, those are the ones the crowd seems to chase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Update: mice in charge</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/6-06/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:00:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/6-06/</guid><description>&lt;p>The mice have unionized, and I’m their emotional support human.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Living in Miceolation</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-31/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 09:47:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-31/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="living-in-miceolation">

&lt;p>To my fellow intellectuals,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another quiet day in the lab. It’s just me and the mice again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spend more time with them than anyone else these days. They watch me when I enter, scurry over when I speak, and honestly—I think they get me. I know it sounds crazy, but they’ve started talking to me. Not in words exactly, but in little squeaks and looks. I understand them. They give advice, comfort, sometimes even sass.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Of Mice and Mountains: the exploding meatball sub</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>I once read that if you rolled all 8 billion humans into a meatball, you could fit it neatly into Central Park. I can’t stop thinking about that — how small we really are when reduced to matter. I imagine an alien scientist doing it not out of cruelty, but curiosity. To them, we’re just a species to study. Maybe they want to understand memory. Maybe they want to fix their version of Alzheimer’s. Maybe they hear us scream and mark it down as “auditory output, irrelevant to findings.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mice Mice Baby</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>neurons dance like disco balls—
cue the lab beat drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pipettes in motion,
CRISPR cuts with icy grace,
edit, splice, and pop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Axons light the floor,
calcium waves riding high,
voltage gates unlock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dendrites sway and flex,
neurotransmitters in sync,
groovin’ with the clock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hypothalamus
drops a circadian hook—
sleep mode: bassline shock&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Of Mice and Mountains: A New Chapter Begins</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-11_post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-11_post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I’m Made —life took a turn,&lt;br>
Left New York streets for labs where I learn.&lt;br>
Now I’m going to L.A., where palm trees are nice,&lt;br>
But mostly I’m here to study some mice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neuroscience! Brains! A glamorous grind,&lt;br>
Staring at neurons and losing my mind.&lt;br>
It’s scary! It’s sunny! I barely go out—&lt;br>
But hey, the mice seem chill (no doubt).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
