I can’t stop thinking about that — how small we really are when reduced to matter. I imagine an alien scientist doing it not out of cruelty, but curiosity. To them, we’re just a species to study. Maybe they want to understand memory. Maybe they want to fix their version of Alzheimer’s. Maybe they hear us scream and mark it down as “auditory output, irrelevant to findings.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mice Mice Baby</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>neurons dance like disco balls—
cue the lab beat drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pipettes in motion,
CRISPR cuts with icy grace,
edit, splice, and pop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Axons light the floor,
calcium waves riding high,
voltage gates unlock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dendrites sway and flex,
neurotransmitters in sync,
groovin’ with the clock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hypothalamus
drops a circadian hook—
sleep mode: bassline shock&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Of Mice and Mountains: A New Chapter Begins</title><link>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-11_post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://madelinebacon.github.io/posts/5-11_post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I’m Made —life took a turn,&lt;br>
Left New York streets for labs where I learn.&lt;br>
Now I’m going to L.A., where palm trees are nice,&lt;br>
But mostly I’m here to study some mice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neuroscience! Brains! A glamorous grind,&lt;br>
Staring at neurons and losing my mind.&lt;br>
It’s scary! It’s sunny! I barely go out—&lt;br>
But hey, the mice seem chill (no doubt).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
