Welcome to my website! My name is Madeline Bacon, and I'm a 23-year-old from Maryland with a passion for psychology and research. I recently completed my studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I delved deep into the fascinating world of psychology.

As a curious and enthusiastic learner, my academic journey has been an exciting exploration of the human mind and behavior. I am particularly intrigued by the intricate workings of the brain and how it influences our thoughts, emotions, and actions.

Having graduated with a degree in Psychology, I am now embarking on a thrilling new chapter in my life. I have recently made the exciting move to the vibrant city of New York, where I am eager to dive into the realm of research. This dynamic city provides the perfect backdrop for my pursuit of knowledge and understanding in the field of psychology.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research that sheds light on various aspects of human behavior, cognition, and mental health. Through my work, I aspire to make a positive impact on the lives of others, fostering a deeper understanding of ourselves and our interactions with the world around us.

On this website, I aim to share my academic insights, research findings, and personal reflections as I navigate the world of psychology and research. I invite you to join me on this exciting journey, where we can explore the intricacies of the mind together.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my work both engaging and enlightening. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.
