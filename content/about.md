Welcome! My name is Madeline Bacon, and I'm from Maryland with a passion for psychology and research. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I delved deep into the fascinating world of psychology.

As a curious and enthusiastic learner, my academic journey has been an exciting exploration of the human mind and behavior. I am particularly intrigued by the intricate workings of the brain and how it influences our thoughts, emotions, and actions.
