I once read that if you rolled all 8 billion humans into a meatball, you could fit it neatly into Central Park. I can’t stop thinking about that — how small we really are when reduced to matter. I imagine an alien scientist doing it not out of cruelty, but curiosity. To them, we’re just a species to study. Maybe they want to understand memory. Maybe they want to fix their version of Alzheimer’s. Maybe they hear us scream and mark it down as “auditory output, irrelevant to findings.”

In my lab, I study mice. Each one is named Lenny. They don’t scream, but sometimes they twitch. I track the symphony of their neurons as they solve puzzles and hesitate at corners, little windows into cognition. Sometimes they die. Not violently — just quietly, scientifically. I tell myself it’s for something bigger. But as I watch another brain flicker its last signal, I can’t help but wonder: are we the scientists, or are we the meatball?
