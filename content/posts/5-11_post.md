Hi, I’m Made —life took a turn,  
Left New York streets for labs where I learn.  
Now I’m going to L.A., where palm trees are nice,  
But mostly I’m here to study some mice.

Neuroscience! Brains! A glamorous grind,  
Staring at neurons and losing my mind.  
It’s scary! It’s sunny! I barely go out—  
But hey, the mice seem chill (no doubt).
