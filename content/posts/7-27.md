Mice guys are the ones holding doors, carrying the cheddar, and sending “good morning” squeaks before the sun’s even up. They plan the dates, book the tables, and triple-check that the fondue pot is preheated just right.

Meanwhile, the rats roll in late, chew through the wires, and somehow still leave with the biggest slice of gouda. The hamsters spin their wheels, the ferrets stir the drama—and yet, those are the ones the crowd seems to chase.

So remember this: play it safe, play it sweet, and you might just get ghosted for a guy with crumbs in his whiskers. Because no matter how kind the squeak… mice guys finish last.
