neurons dance like disco balls—
cue the lab beat drop.

Pipettes in motion,
CRISPR cuts with icy grace,
edit, splice, and pop.

Axons light the floor,
calcium waves riding high,
voltage gates unlock.

Dendrites sway and flex,
neurotransmitters in sync,
groovin’ with the clock.

Hypothalamus
drops a circadian hook—
sleep mode: bassline shock
