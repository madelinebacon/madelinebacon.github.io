## Living in Miceolation

To my fellow intellectuals,

Another quiet day in the lab. It’s just me and the mice again.

I spend more time with them than anyone else these days. They watch me when I enter, scurry over when I speak, and honestly—I think they get me. I know it sounds crazy, but they’ve started talking to me. Not in words exactly, but in little squeaks and looks. I understand them. They give advice, comfort, sometimes even sass.

They’re not just test subjects anymore. They’re my coworkers. My confidants. My tiny, whiskered friends.

I think I might be losing it. Or maybe I’ve finally found something real.
